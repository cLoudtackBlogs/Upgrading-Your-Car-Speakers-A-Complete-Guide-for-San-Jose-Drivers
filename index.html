                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Podcasts/Audiobooks:</b> Focus on clear midrange reproduction where voices reside
                </p>
                <h3>Budget Considerations</h3>
                <p>
                    Speaker upgrades are available at various price points:
                </p>
                <p>

                    The Bay Area's microclimate variations require some maintenance considerations:

                 </p>
